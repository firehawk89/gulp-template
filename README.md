# GULP template

This is my GULP template for websites developing using SCSS and autoprefixer.

## Installation

First of all consider that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/uk) and [GULP](https://gulpjs.com/) on your computer.

To install template packages run this command in the project folder:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

All development is conducted in the `src` folder.

To run the local server and start developing, use this command:

```
gulp
```

To build the project run this command:

```
gulp build
```

The `build` folder with all needed result files will appear in your project directory.
